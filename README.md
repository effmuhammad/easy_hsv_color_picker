# Easy HSV Color Picker
> This script uses OpenCV to generate the upper and lower HSV ranges of any pixel in an RGB image (tolerances could be modified in code). Very useful for color recognition in image processing algorithms.

Currently developing the GUI for Easy HSV Color Picker

Inspired from HSV Color Picker by https://github.com/alieldinayman
